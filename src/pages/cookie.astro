            <h3>Use of Cookies:</h3>
            <p>We use cookies exclusively for the following purposes:</p>
            <p>
                <strong> Analytics:</strong> Tools like Google Analytics use cookies
                to collect information about how visitors use our site. These data
                are processed on Google's servers in an aggregated form, providing
                insights such as the number of visitors, where visitors have come
                from, and the pages they navigated to. This aggregation ensures that
                no individual user can be identified from the data, helping us improve
                our website and enhance user experience while maintaining user privacy.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong> Advertising:</strong> Advertising cookies are used to track
                the effectiveness of ad campaigns and to display ads that are more
                relevant to you. These cookies are managed on servers operated by
                Google and other third-party advertisers, which make decisions about
                the ads based on data gathered from their cookies. The data used
                for advertising are processed in an aggregated form, ensuring that
                they do not personally identify any individual user. These aggregated
                data help advertisers optimize the relevance and effectiveness of
                their ads while respecting user privacy.
            </p>
            <p>
                We do not use cookies for purposes other than those listed
                above. By managing and limiting the use of cookies to these
                purposes, we ensure your data is used responsibly and
                transparently.
