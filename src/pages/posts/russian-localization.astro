        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Did you know that Russian is spoken by over <a
                href="https://unric.org/en/russian-language-many-shades-of-blue/"
                >258 million people worldwide</a
            >, making it the 8<sup>th</sup> most spoken language globally? With the
            current geopolitical challenges, connecting directly with Russian speakers
            in Russia might be tricky. But here is the good news: there are 114 million
            Russian speakers residing outside of Russia. Imagine tapping into a market
            larger than the populations of many countries!
        </p>
        <p>
            Many businesses, software and website developers, e-commerce store
            owners, and digital marketing professionals may choose to ignore
            this significant pool of potential customers, often due to perceived
            complexities. And it is the easiest path to take.
        </p>

        <p>
            However, there is another option that, though more challenging and
            seemingly contrarian at the moment, could be far more rewarding. By
            engaging with this customer base, you can stand out from the
            competition and potentially reap significant benefits from a market
            that may not be fully leveraged yet.
        </p>
        <p>
            To truly benefit, it is crucial not to overlook the nuances of
            communicating with this vast audience. One might think that reaching
            the Russian-speaking audience (or any audience, for that matter) is
            as easy as translating content using tools like Google Translate or
            DeepL.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, this approach barely scratches the surface. Simply
            translating a website or a web app into another language does not
            ensure that it is properly localized for the intended audience,
            which means it won't be culturally relevant. Additionally, mere
            translation does not address optimization for online discoverability
            of content. This can result in search engines driving your
            translated web pages to obscurity. Clearly, in this case, relying
            solely on translation is a waste of both time and money. Therefore,
            adopting a holistic approach to communication is essential.
        </p>

        <h2 id="understanding-localization">
            Understanding localization: more than just translation
        </h2>

        <p>
            Before discussing the importance of localizing content into Russian,
            it is worth first explaining the terminology involved.
        </p>
        <p>
            For some, translation might seem as simple as inputting text into
            Google Translate, resulting in an instant translation. While machine
            translation can indeed accelerate the process and assist with basic
            translations, it often overlooks cultural nuances, making it less
            reliable for nuanced or sensitive content. However, for obtaining a
            general understanding of non-critical texts, this method, followed
            by thorough proofreading and revision by a human, can sometimes be
            adequate.
        </p>
        <p>
            For those requiring professional-grade translation, the process
            involves more than simple text conversion from one language to
            another. It is about transforming a text from a source language into
            a target language while conveying the original meaning as accurately
            as possible. This level of precision is crucial, especially in
            industries where the slightest misinterpretation can lead to
            significant consequences.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, when translating SaaS (Software as a Service) products,
            online tools, platforms that rely on web traffic, web apps,
            websites, online content, and landing pages that target specific
            audiences with commercial intent, mere translation falls short. It
            is not just about changing words from one language to another; you
            want your content to be culturally relevant and resonate deeply with
            your target audience to encourage conversions. This requires
            adapting the entire user experience, not just the text. This is
            where the true value of localization becomes apparent.
        </p>
        <p>
            As you may have guessed, localization encompasses a wider spectrum.
            It includes <a
                href="https://www.getblend.com/blog/localization-vs-translation/"
            >
                a variety of factors</a
            > critical for ensuring your content resonates with a new audience:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>control of date and time formats and currency presentation;</li>
            <li>cultural nuances like preferred colors, symbols, and music;</li>
            <li>
                adherence to specific regulations, legal requirements, and
                financial particulars;
            </li>
            <li>
                subtleties in language such as humor, slogans, emotional
                connections, taglines, and customer interactions;
            </li>
            <li>
                understanding of product features and their relevance to the new
                audience;
            </li>
            <li>
                knowledge of prevalent devices, platforms, and social media used
                by the target audience.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Overall, localization includes two key types of adaptation:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Cultural adaptation: This involves more than linguistic changes.
                To truly resonate with the target audience, content must be
                adapted culturally. This includes aligning content with local
                customs, cultural references, societal norms, and even humor.
            </li>
            <li>
                Functional adaptation: In the case of products, especially
                digital ones like software and websites, localization also
                involves adapting functional aspects such as date formats,
                currency, and legal requirements to ensure the product is usable
                in the target region.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            To summarize, at its core, translation is about transforming text
            from one language to another while preserving the original meaning.
            Localization, however, goes much further. It adapts the entire
            product or content to appear native to a new audience. The scope of
            localization is boundless, reaching well beyond the confines of
            translation.
        </p>

        <p>
            What is remarkable about effective localization is that, when done
            well, it makes a program, website, or mobile app seem as though it
            was tailor-made for the user, creating a seamless experience that
            feels completely natural.

            Why Russian localization matters: strategic insights
        </h2>

        <p>
            Now that we have clarified the basic terminology, let us explore why
            it is strategically wise for businesses to start or continue
            localizing their products and online content for the global
            Russian-speaking audience, despite the current challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
            As mentioned in the introduction to this post, there are 114 million
            Russian speakers who live and work outside of Russiaâ€”a significant
            number that surpasses the entire populations of countries such as
            <a

            >, etc. These comparisons highlight the immense size of the
            Russian-speaking population abroad. For businesses aiming to
            increase revenues and expand their customer base, overlooking this
            vast market could result in missed opportunities.
        </p>
        <p>
            Nobody can predict the future, but it is not beyond possibility that
            international relations will normalize. By proactively embracing the
            localization of your content into Russian now, your business will be
            well-prepared to tap into an even larger marketâ€”potentially the
            entire 258 million Russian speakers globallyâ€”when the opportunity
            arises. Staying ahead of the curve is crucial for success.
        </p>
        <p>
            Russian localization can also provide a competitive edge. Companies
            that make an effort to adapt their content specifically for
            Russian-speaking markets may stand out from competitors who do not,
            potentially capturing a larger share of the market.
        </p>

            To summarize, localizing your products, websites, and content into

            How to benefit: consider the nuances of communication
        </h2>

        <p>
            If you have chosen the challenging yet potentially more rewarding
            path of engaging with the Russian-speaking audience worldwide, it is
            crucial to consider the nuances of communication with this diverse
            group. To truly benefit, understanding and addressing these nuances
            can make a significant difference in how your message is received.
        </p>
        <p>
            No matter the nature of your productâ€”be it desktop software, an
            industrial application, a web app, a website, a landing page, or any
            online content targeting a specific audience with commercial
            intentâ€”localization is essential. Effective localization ensures
            that the benefits of your products or services are communicated
            clearly and that they are convenient to use. Ideally, you want your
            content to be culturally relevant and resonate with your target
            audience.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the primary goal is merely to make content understandable or to
            ensure that a product functions correctly in a new market,
            localization may suffice. This approach is typically adequate for
            internal documents, legal papers, user manuals, or certain types of
            software, such as internal tools, where online discoverability via
            search engines is not a concern.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, for any content or product intended to be discovered
            online, excluding Search Engine Optimization (SEO) from the
            localization process could significantly undermine its
            effectiveness. Without SEO, even well-localized content might not
            reach the intended audience, reducing its impact and ROI, as search
            engines drive your translated and localized web content down the
            rankings toward page 100 obscurity.
        </p>
        <p>
            You may wonder how SEO relates to communicating with your target
            audience. The connection is direct. For instance, by implementing an
            SEO strategy for the Russian language, you can analyze and predict
            the search intent of your audience. This allows you to use primary,
            secondary, and long-tail keywords on your web pages that your
            audience is most likely to use in their native language when
            searching for relevant content, products, or services. In this way,
            SEO serves as a form of inbound communication, helping potential
            customers find you online.
        </p>

        <h2 id="localization-seo">
            Localization and SEO: a vital duo for global engagement
        </h2> 

        <p>
            Of course, you already know this if you have built your own website
            or landing page. When you create a website in your native language,
            such as English, the work does not stop there. It must be optimized
            for SEO; otherwise, it will struggle to be found in search engines.
            Thus, you begin the process of optimization, which involves several
            key steps. It is important to note that there are many nuances to
            each step that are beyond the scope of this article. The purpose
            here is to provide a general overview of the process:

        <p>
            Similar to how you optimize web pages in your native language, it is
            recommended that you apply the same SEO principles to your localized
            content. This ensures that your content is discoverable online when
            users search with keywords in their native language. However, it is
            important to conduct keyword research using the target language.
        </p>
        <p>
            Simply localizing your website, web apps, and landing pages into
            Russian without comprehensive SEO efforts is unlikely to improve
            your website traffic or attract a new audience. To achieve
            significant online visibility, it is essential to conduct keyword
            research and implement other critical optimizations, such as meta
            tags, structured data, and semantic consistency in Russian.
        </p>
        <p>
            By leveraging SEO, you can target more clients, provide a better
            user experience, build credibility and reputation, and significantly
            increase website traffic and conversions. Importantly, as an organic
            channel, SEOâ€”while not always inexpensiveâ€”is significantly cheaper
            over time compared to paid strategies.
        </p>
        <p>
            Russian localization alone can meet basic functional and
            communicative needs, but for digital content aimed at public or
            commercial audiences, integrating SEO is crucial to fully leverage
            the advantages of localization. SEO maximizes the benefits of
            localization by ensuring that the content is both discoverable and
            relevant to the local audience, thereby reinforcing the purpose of
            localization.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thus, if and when you decide to tap into the 114 million
            Russian-speaking customer base to drive your global sales growth, it
            is wise to adopt a holistic approach. This approach should be based
            on nuanced and thoughtful communication through translation,
            localization, and SEO.
