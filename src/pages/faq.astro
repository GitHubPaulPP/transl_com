                        We place the highest priority on delivering superior
                        quality translations. To achieve this, we have
                        implemented several stringent quality control measures:

                    <p><strong>Expert translation team:</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        All of our translators are not only native speakers of
                        the Russian language but also hold degrees in
                        linguistics or related fields. Their extensive
                        experience and deep cultural as well as linguistic
                        understanding ensure that they grasp even the most
                        subtle nuances.

                    <p><strong>Rigorous proofreading process:</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        To further ensure accuracy, every translation undergoes
                        a meticulous proofreading process by a second linguist.
                        This step is crucial as it helps to eliminate any
                        potential errors or inaccuracies that might have slipped
                        through during the initial translation phase.

                    <p><strong>CAT tools:</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        We employ advanced computer-assisted translation (CAT)
                        tools to support our translators in enhancing the
                        accuracy and consistency of our translations. It's
                        important to clarify that these are NOT machine
                        translation tools. Unlike machine translation, CAT tools
                        aid human translators by providing helpful resources
                        such as translation memories and terminology databases,
                        which ensure consistency in language use across
                        projects.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Using CAT tools is a hallmark of professional
                        translation practices, distinguishing expert translators
                        from amateurs. These tools enhance a translator's
                        ability to produce high-quality, culturally appropriate
                        translations. They support, rather than replace, the
                        nuanced skills of human translators

                        Yes, we specialize in translating and localizing

                        content to capture the nuances of the Russian language
                        but also adapting it culturally to resonate with your
                        target audience, ensuring your site communicates
                        effectively and professionally in its new market. If
                        required, we also provide SEO translation to enhance
                        your online content's visibility and ranking in the

                        When discussing areas of specialization, it's important
                        to distinguish between the types of services we offer
                        and the areas we specialize in. A common
                        misunderstanding is to confuse services with areas of
                        expertise, such as thinking "legal translation" is a
                        service. However, "translation" is the service, and
                        "legal" is the area of expertise. This distinction helps
                        clarify that our services, such as translation or
                        localization, are offered across different fields or
                        industries like legal, finance, etc.

                        We provide the option to include a Certificate of
                        Translation Accuracy with your order, which confirms
                        that the translation was performed by a professional
                        native translator to the highest standard of accuracy.
                        This certificate is available for an additional fee of
                        €15.00, or 3% of the total order price for orders
                        exceeding €500. It is important to note that this
                        certification differs from a sworn translation, which is
                        conducted by an officially appointed (sworn) translator.

                        We are proficient in all major CAT tools, including SDL

                        others. However, we have decided against using
                        proprietary, closed-source applications and instead
                        stick to open-source software for our clients' benefit
                        to help protect their content with utmost security and
                        confidentiality. The benefits of using open-source tools
                        include improved transparency that ensures there are no
                        hidden functionalities that could potentially affect
                        security and privacy, quicker vulnerability resolutions
                        by a robust community (which enhances security measures
                        more efficiently than proprietary tools can), and
                        enhanced customization capabilities. We utilize OmegaT
                        and MateCat — both reputable open-source CAT tools that

                        We understand that some translation projects require
                        special attention and confidentiality. To ensure the
                        proper protection of your data, we are always ready to

                        Furthermore, to enhance security and confidentiality, we
                        exclusively use open-source CAT tools for projects.
                        These tools are preferred because they do not have any
                        hidden functionalities that could potentially compromise
                        your data. Open-source software is continually audited
                        by software security professionals, which helps to
                        quickly identify and resolve any security

                        from our computers, if required. This practice ensures

                        For example, under the Basic tier priced at €0.08 per
                        word, a document with 300 words would cost €24.00 (0.08
                        (per word rate) × 300 (number of words) = €24.00).

                        If you require proofreading or revision services for

                        services at <strong>an hourly rate of €30</strong>. This
                        is because the time it takes to proofread or revise a
                        document can vary significantly depending on the quality
                        of the original translation:

                                their higher initial quality.

                                proofreading or revision is sufficient.

                                and economical to retranslate the text rather
                                than attempting to revise it extensively.

                        Typically, a human translator can produce about 300
                        words in an hour or manage to complete around 2,500
                        words in a day. It is important to consider additional
                        time for proofreading and quality assurance to ensure
                        the highest standard of the translated text.

                        The daily output of translation work can fluctuate based
                        on the specific complexities and requirements of each
                        project. For larger volumes needing rapid completion, we
                        welcome a discussion to align with your deadlines and
                        will make every effort to meet your needs. Quality
                        remains paramount in our work; we commit to delivering
                        accurate and meticulously detailed translations.

                        The precise timeline for your project will be determined
                        and agreed upon with you in advance of commencement.
